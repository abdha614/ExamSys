Expert Systems (النظم الخبيرة): A quick revision
▪An expert system 
generally consists of four 
components:
◦Knowledge base (Rules)
◦Search or inference system,
◦Knowledge acquisition 
system,
◦User interface or 
communication system.

What is Machine Learning?
▪Machine Learning is a type of 
Artificial Intelligence that 
provides computers with the 
ability to learn
▪Getting computers to program 
themselves

When Do We Use Machine Learning?
▪ML is used when:
◦Human expertise does not exist (navigating on Mars),
◦Humans are unable to explain their expertise (speech 
recognition, OCR)
◦Solution changes in time (routing on a computer 
network, stock market)
◦Solution needs to be adapted to particular cases 
(recommendation systems)
▪Learning is not always useful:
◦There is no need to “learn” to calculate payroll.

Common ML Applications
▪Recognizing patterns:
◦Facial identities or facial expressions.
◦Handwritten or spoken words.
◦Medical images.
◦Sentiment Analysis.
▪Generating patterns:
◦Generating images or motion 
sequences.
◦Articles generation.
▪Recognizing anomalies:
◦Unusual credit card transactions 
▪Prediction:
◦Future stock prices or currency 
exchange rates

Types of Learning
▪Supervised (inductive) learning (التعلم المشرف عليه): Training data includes
desired outputs
◦Regression: predict numerical values
◦Classification: predict categorical values, i.e., labels
▪Unsupervised learning (التعلم غير المشرف عليه): Training data does not include 
desired outputs
◦Clustering: group data according to "distance"
◦Association: find frequent co-occurrences
◦Link prediction: discover relationships in data
◦Data reduction: project features to fewer features
▪Semi-supervised learning
◦Training data includes a few desired outputs
▪Reinforcement learning (التعلم المعزز)
◦Learn to act based on feedback/reward.

Supervised Learning Techniques
▪Numerical classifier functions
◦Linear classifier, perceptron, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), 
neural networks 
▪Parametric (probabilistic) functions 
◦Naïve Bayes, Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), hidden Markov models (HMM), 
probabilistic graphical models 
▪Non-parametric (instance-based) functions
◦k-nearest neighbors, kernel regression, kernel density estimation, local regression
▪Symbolic functions
◦Decision trees, classification and regression trees (CART)
▪Aggregation (ensemble) learning
◦Bagging, boosting (Adaboost), random forest
