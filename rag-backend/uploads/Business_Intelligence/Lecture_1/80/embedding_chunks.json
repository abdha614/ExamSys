The Data: defining which data will be loaded into the system and\nanalyzed.\n2. The ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) Engine: moving the source data\nto the Data Warehouse. This can be a complex step involving\nmodifications and calculations on the data itself. If this step doesn’t work\nproperly, the BI solution simply cannot be effective.\n3. Data Warehousing: connects electronic data from different operational\nsystems so that the data can be queried and analyzed over time for\nbusiness decision making.\n4. Analytic Engine: analyzes multidimensional data sets found in a data\nwarehouse to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.\n5.
