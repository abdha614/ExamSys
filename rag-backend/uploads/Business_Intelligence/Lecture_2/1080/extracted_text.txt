Why Data Mining? 
3
The Explosive Growth of Data: from terabytes to
petabytes
Data collection and data availability
Automated
data
collection
tools,
database
systems,
Web,
computerized society
Major sources of abundant data
Business:Web, e-commerce, transactions, stocks, …
Science: Remote sensing, bioinformatics, scientific simulation, …
Society and everyone: news, digital cameras,YouTube
We are drowning in data, but starving for knowledge!
“Necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention”—Data
mining—Automated analysis of massive data sets

Evolution of Sciences
4

Before 1600, empirical science

1600-1950s, theoretical science

Each discipline has grown a theoretical component. Theoretical models often motivate
experiments and generalize our understanding.

1950s-1990s, computational science

Over the last 50 years, most disciplines have grown a third, computational branch (e.g.
empirical, theoretical, and computational ecology, or physics, or linguistics.)

Computational Science traditionally meant simulation. It grew out of our inability to find
closed-form solutions for complex mathematical models.

1990-now, data science

The flood of data from new scientific instruments and simulations

The ability to economically store and manage petabytes of data online

The Internet and computing Grid that makes all these archives universally accessible

Scientific info. management, acquisition, organization, query, and visualization tasks scale
almost linearly with data volumes. Data mining is a major new challenge!
