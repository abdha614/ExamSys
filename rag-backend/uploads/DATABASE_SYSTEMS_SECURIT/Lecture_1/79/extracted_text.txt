DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
INFORMATION SECURITY
Information is one of an organization’s most valuable assets
Information is safe if it is protected from access by unauthorized users.
At the same time (to be useful) information must be accessible at all times to 
authorized users.
17
Information security consists of procedures and measures taken to protect
information systems components.


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
C.I.A. TRIANGLE
The concept of information security is based on the C.I.A. triangle according to 
the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security 
Committee (NSTISSC)
C.I.A. triangle: 
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability

INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
CONFIDENTIALITY
Confidentiality is the prevention of 
unauthorized individuals from 
knowing or accessing secret 
information.
Company information should be 
classified into different levels:
Information are classified based on the 
degree of confidentiality
Each level has its own security measures
20


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
INTEGRITY
Data is considered to have integrity if it is accurate and has not been tampered 
with intentionally or accidentally.
Data must be protected at all levels to achieve full integrity.
Consistent and valid data, processed correctly, yields accurate information
Example of a violation of data integrity

INTEGRITY
Type of Data Degradation
Description
Reasons for Data Losing Integrity
Invalid data
Not all the entered and stored data is valid.
Checks and validation processes that prevent invalid
data are missing.
User enters invalid data mistakenly or intentionally.
Application code does not validate inputted data.
Redundant data
The same data is recorded and stored in several
places;
This can
lead to data inconsistency and data
anomalies.
Faulty data design that does not conform to the data
normalization process.
Inconsistent data
Occurs when redundant data, which resides in
several places, is not identical.
Faulty database design that does not conform to the
data normalization process.
22
Degradation of data integrity

INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
INTEGRITY
Type of Data Degradation
Description
Reasons for Data Losing Integrity
Data anomalies
Exists when there is redundant data and one
occurrence of the repeated data is changed and the
other occurrences are not.
Faulty data design that does not conform to the data
normalization process.
Data read inconsistency
The user does not always read the last committed
data.
Data changes that are made by the user are visible
to others before changes are committed.
DBMS does not support or has weak implementation
of the read consistency feature.
Data nonconcurrency
Multiple users can access and read data at the same
time but they lose read consistency.
DBMS does not support or has weak implementation
of the read consistency feature.
23
Degradation of data integrity


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
AVAILABILITY
The systems should be always available to authorized users
The systems should determine what a user can do with the information
Reasons for a system to become unavailable:
External attacks and lack of system protection
System failure with no disaster recovery strategy
Overly stringent and obscure security policies
Bad implementation of authentication processes
How is availability related to security?

28


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY
The database administrator have to implement security at all levels 
of the database.
To protect data stored in the database, the various security access 
points that can make your database vulnerable must be known.
29


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Security access point: 
Place where database security must 
be applied (implemented, enforced, and 
audited)
30


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
The major access points within a database 
environment where security measures must 
be applied:
People
Applications
Networks
Operating system
Database management system
Data files
Data
31


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
People: 
Individuals who have permissions to 
access applications, networks, servers, 
databases, data files, and data. 
People represent a risk of database security 
violations. 
Database security must secure the data 
against violations caused by people.
32


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Applications: 
Application which includes permissions
granted to people. 
If these permissions are too loose, 
individuals can access and violate data. 
Extreme caution should be exercised when 
granting security privileges to 
applications.
33


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Network: 
One of the most sensitive security access 
points. 
The network should be protected with the 
best efforts
34


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Operating system: 
The operating system access point consists 
of the authentication mechanism for 
logging into the system, which acts as the 
gateway to access the data.
(to access the data residing in a system, you 
must log on and your security credentials 
must be verified). 
The absence of good security measures at 
this access point is the cause of most 
security violations.
35


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
DBMS: 
The logical structure of the database, 
which includes memory, executables, and 
other binaries.
36


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Data files: 
Access to data files where data resides. 
Data files belonging to the database must be 
protected from being accessed by 
unauthorized individuals through the 
use of permissions and encryption.
37


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Data: 
The data access point deals with:
the data design needed to enforce data 
integrity, 
the application implementation needed to 
ensure data validity, 
the privileges necessary to access data.
38
Data requires highest level of protection.
Data access point must be small.


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Notes:
The proximity of database security to the access 
point indicates the proximity to database 
security violations.
The area of the access point indicates the security 
risk. 
The people is the largest area because there is a 
huge community of individuals who access data. 
The data file access point is smaller than any of the 
points above it, which means that the security risks 
for data files is not as high as at DBMS access 
points. 
39


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY ACCESS POINTS
Notes:
Reducing DBMS access points makes the data files 
access point even less accessible.
The database must be secured, starting with the 
access points of people, followed by applications, and 
so on.
40
Reducing access point size reduces security risks, 
which in turn increases database security.


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATA INTEGRITY VIOLATION PROCESS

Security access point is a point at which security 
measures are needed to prevent access that can 
involve unauthorized actions.

Security gaps are points at which security is 
missing, and thus the system is vulnerable.
41

Vulnerabilities are kinks in the system that must 
be watched because they can become threats.

A threat is defined as a security risk that can 
become a system breach.

The breach can be caused by either intentional or 
unintentional actions.
The process of a security gap eventually resulting in a security breach:


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY LEVELS
Relational database: collection of related data files
Data file: collection of related tables
Table: collection of related rows (records)
Row: collection of related columns (fields)
The structure of the database is organized in levels
Each level can be protected by a different security 
mechanism.
42


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY LEVELS
A column can be protected by using a VIEW
object.  
A table is protected through the functionality of the 
database system, which allows schema owners to 
grant or revoke privileges.
The data files are protected by the database and 
that protection is enforced by operating system 
file permissions.
43


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING 
INSTRUCTOR: DR. CHRISTINE ZENIEH
DATABASE SECURITY LEVELS
The database is secured by the database 
management system through:
the use of user accounts and passwords
the privileges and permissions of the main 
database functions
database backup and recovery
etc.
44


DATABASE SYSTEMS SECURITY– SYRIAN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY – FACULTY OF INFORMATICS ENGINEERING
