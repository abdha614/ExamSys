Git commands


Recording changes to the repo
Each file in your working directory can be in one 
of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files 
are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as 
any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, 
modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files 
that Git knows about.
Untracked files are everything else — any files in 
your working directory that were not in your last 
snapshot and are not in your staging area. When 
you first clone a repository, all of your files will be 
tracked and unmodified because Git just checked 
them out and you haven’t edited anything.


Checking the Status of Your Files 
• The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git 
status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should 
see something like this:


Let’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file. If the file didn’t exist before, and you 
run git status, you see your untracked file like so: 


Tracking New Files 
• In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin 
tracking the Project file, you can run this:


Staging Modified Files
• Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously 
tracked file called project.txt and then run your git status command again, 
you get something that looks like this: 


• The project.txt file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for 
commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the 
working directory but not yet staged. 
• To stage it, you run the git add command. 
• git add is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to 
stage files, and to do other things.


Short Status
• While the git status output is pretty comprehensive, it’s also quite wordy. 
• Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more 
compact way.
•  If you run git status -s or git status --short you get a far more simplified 
output from the command:


• New files that aren’t tracked have a ?? next to them 
• new files that have been added to the staging area have an A
• modified files have an M and so on.
•  There are two columns to the output — the lefthand column indicates the 
status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of 
the working tree. 


Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes 
• If the git status command is too unclear for you — you want to know 
exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use 
the git diff command.


• If you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can 
use git diff --staged. This command compares your staged changes to your last 
commit:
• It’s important to note that git diff by itself doesn’t show all changes made since your 
last commit — only changes that are still unstaged. If  you’ve staged all of  your 
changes, git diff  will give you no output


Committing Your Changes 
• Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your 
changes. 
• Remember that anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or 
modified that you haven’t run git add on since you edited them — won’t go into this 
commit. 
• They will stay as modified files on your disk. In this case, let’s say that the last time 
you ran git status, you saw that everything was staged, so you’re ready to commit 
your changes.
•  The simplest way to commit is to type git commit




Removing Files 
• To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files 
(more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit. 
• The git rm command does that, and also removes the file from your working 
directory so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around. 
• If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under 
the “Changes not staged for commit” (that is, unstaged) area of your git 
status output




Moving Files 
• Unlike many other VCSs, Git doesn’t explicitly track file movement. 
• If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you 
renamed the file. 
• Thus it’s a bit confusing that Git has a mv command. If you want to rename 
a file in Git, you can run something like
