Tracked files \nare files that were in the last snapshot, as well as \nany newly staged files; they can be unmodified, \nmodified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files \nthat Git knows about.\nUntracked files are everything else — any files in \nyour working directory that were not in your last \nsnapshot and are not in your staging area. When \nyou first clone a repository, all of your files will be \ntracked and unmodified because Git just checked \nthem out and you haven’t edited anything.\n\n\nChecking the Status of Your Files \n• The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git \nstatus command.
