Closing the Strategy Gap 
One of the major objectives of computerized decision
support is to facilitate closing the gap between the
current performance of an organization and its desired
performance, as expressed in its mission, objectives, and
goals, and the strategy to achieve them.

Business Intelligence (BI) 
BI is an evolution of decision support concepts over time.
Meaning of EIS/DSS…
Then: Executive Information System
Now: Everybody’s Information System (BI)
BI systems are enhanced with additional visualizations,
alerts, and performance measurement capabilities.
The term BI emerged from industry apps.
Introduction to Business Intelligence

Definition of BI
BI is an umbrella term that combines architectures,
tools, databases, analytical tools, applications, and
methodologies.
BI a content-free expression, so it means different
things to different people.
BI's major objective is to enable easy access to data
(and models) to provide business managers with the
ability to conduct analysis.
BI
helps
transform
data,
to
information
(and
knowledge), to decisions and finally to action.

A Brief History of BI
The term BI was coined by the Gartner Group in the
mid-1990s
However, the concept is much older
1970s — MIS reporting — static/periodic reports
1980s — Executive Information Systems (EIS)
1990s — OLAP, dynamic, multidimensional, ad-hoc reporting
-> coining of the term “BI”
2005+ — Inclusion of AI and Data/Text Mining capabilities;
Web-based Portals/Dashboards
2010s —Yet to be seen

The 5 Stages of Business Intelligence 
BI development typically follows the 5 stages listed
below:
1. The Data: defining which data will be loaded into the system and
analyzed.
2. The ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) Engine: moving the source data
to the Data Warehouse. This can be a complex step involving
modifications and calculations on the data itself. If this step doesn’t work
properly, the BI solution simply cannot be effective.
3. Data Warehousing: connects electronic data from different operational
systems so that the data can be queried and analyzed over time for
business decision making.
4. Analytic Engine: analyzes multidimensional data sets found in a data
warehouse to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.
5. Presentation Layer: the dashboards, reports and alerts that present
findings from the analysis.

The Architecture of BI
A BI system has four major components:
a data warehouse, with its source data
business analytics, a collection of tools for manipulating, mining,
and analyzing the data in the data warehouse;
business performance management (BPM) for monitoring and
analyzing performance
a user interface (e.g., dashboard)

A High-level Architecture of BI

Components in a BI Architecture
The data warehouse is the cornerstone of any
medium-to-large BI system.
Originally, the data warehouse included only historical data
that was organized and summarized, so end users could
easily view or manipulate it.
Today, some data warehouses include access to current data
as well, so they can provide real-time decision support (for
details see Chapter 2).
Business analytics are the tools
that help users
transform data into knowledge (e.g., queries, data/text
mining tools, etc.).
Introduction to Business Intelligence

17


BI vs. Business Analytics
Used often interchangeably in the present business
environment
Analytics is more tools oriented, so it mainly refers to the
technology for BI
BI is more of the umbrella term that also includes the
business side of the equation
BI is more of a planning level concept and BA is more of
an implementation level concept
If you think of KPI (Key Performance Indicators), BI
defines them while BA measures them (roughly speaking)
Google Analytics: BI or BA?


Components in a BI Architecture
Business Performance Management (BPM), which is
also
referred
to
as
corporate
performance
management (CPM), is an emerging portfolio of
applications within the BI framework that provides
enterprises tools they need to better manage their
operations
User
Interface
(i.e.,
dashboards)
provides
a
comprehensive graphical/pictorial view of corporate
performance measures, trends, and exceptions.

Styles of BI
MicroStrategy, Corp. distinguishes five styles of BI and
offers tools for each:
1.
report delivery and alerting
2.
enterprise reporting (using dashboards and scorecards)
3.
cube analysis (also known as slice-and-dice analysis)
4.
ad-hoc queries
5.
statistics and data mining

The Benefits of BI
The ability to provide accurate information when
needed, including a real-time view of the corporate
performance and its parts
A survey byThompson (2004)
Faster, more accurate reporting (81%)
Improved decision making (78%)
Improved customer service (56%)
Increased revenue (49%)

Automated Decision Making 
A relatively new approach to supporting decision making
Applies to highly structured decisions
Automated decision systems (ADS)
(or decision automation systems)
An ADS is a rule-based system that provides a solution to
a repetitive managerial problem in a specific area.
e.g., simple-loan approval system

Automated Decision Making 
ADS initially appeared in the airline industry called
revenue (or yield) management (or revenue optimization)
systems.
dynamically price tickets based on actual demand
Today, many service industries use similar pricing models.
ADS are driven by business rules!

Intelligence and Espionage
Stealing corporate secrets, CIA, …
Intelligence vs. Espionage
Intelligence
The way that modern companies ethically and legally
organize themselves to glean as much as they can from their
customers, their business environment, their stakeholders,
their business processes, their competitors, and other such
sources of potentially valuable information
Problem – too much data, very little value
Use of data/text/Web mining (see Chapter 4, 5)
Introduction to Business Intelligence
Dr. Kadan ALJOUMAA
26


Transaction Processing Versus
Analytic Processing
Transaction
processing
systems
are
constantly
involved in handling updates (add/edit/delete) to what
we might call operational databases.
ATM withdrawal transaction, sales order entry via an
ecommerce site – updates DBs
Online analytic processing (OLTP) handles routine on-going
business
ERP, SCM, CRM systems generate and store data in OLTP
systems
The main goal is to have high efficiency
Introduction to Business Intelligence
Dr. Kadan ALJOUMAA
27


Transaction Processing Versus
Analytic Processing
Online
analytic
processing
(OLAP)
systems
are
involved in extracting information from data stored
by OLTP systems
Routine sales reports by product, by region, by sales person,
etc.
Often built on top of a data warehouse where the data is
not transactional
Main goal is effectiveness (and then, efficiency) – provide
correct information in a timely manner
More on OLAP will be covered in Chapter 2

Successful BI Implementation
Implementing and deploying a BI initiative is a lengthy,
expensive and risky endeavor!
Success of a BI system is measured by its widespread
usage for better decision making.
The typical BI user community includes
All levels of the management hierarchy (not just the top
executives, as was for EIS)
Provide what is needed to whom he/she needs it
A successful BI system must be of benefit to the
enterprise as a whole.

Real-time, On-demand BI
The demand for “real-time” BI is growing!
Is “real-time” BI attainable?
Technology is getting there…
Automated, faster data collection (RFID, sensors,… )
Database and other software technologies (agent, SOA, …)
are advancing
Telecommunication infrastructure is improving
Computational power is increasing while the cost for these
technologies is decreasing
Trent -> Business Activity Management
