    "text": "Tooth portions (crown & root)\nThe enamel, cementum and dentine are the three hard tissues of the tooth, and the dentine forms the major bulk of the tooth structure. While, the fourth tissue of the tooth is the pulp which is the soft tissue, within the dentin providing blood supply, innervation and connective tissue. The primary function of the pulp is to produce dentin.\nThe pulp consists of two parts, the pulp chamber and the pulp canal. The pulp chamber is that part of the dental pulp inside the crown, while the pulp canal is inside the root.\n\nThe number of roots\nsingle root as in all anterior teeth, mandibular premolars and maxillary second premolars.\ntwo roots with bifurcation which is the division of the root trunk into two branches as in mandibular molars and maxillary first premolars.\nthree roots with trifurcation which is the division of the root trunk into three branches as in maxillary molars.\nRoot Trunk is the base of the root of a multirooted tooth.\nTerminal Roots is the branching of the root from the root trunk.\nApex is the terminal end or tip of the root."

    "text": "Surfaces of the teeth\nThe crowns of incisors and canines have 4 surfaces and a ridge and the crowns of premolars and molars have 5 surfaces.\n•1.Labial surface: is the surface which is towards the lip in incisors and canines (=in anterior teeth).\n•2.Buccal surface: is the surface which is towards the cheek in premolars and molars (=in posterior teeth).\n•The labial and buccal surfaces could be termed as the “ Facial surfaces “.\n3.Lingual surface: is the surface which is facing the tongue (all teeth).\n•4.Occlusal surface: is the surface of posterior teeth coming in contact with the teeth in the opposite jaw during closing the mouth. In anterior teeth this surface is called “ Incisal ridge”.\n5.Proximal surface: is the surface of the tooth facing towards adjacent teeth in the same dental arch.\n•A. Mesial surface: is the surface which is facing towards the median line.\n•B. Distal surface: is the surface which is facing away from the median line.\nSurfaces of the teeth\n•All teeth have their mesial surfaces touching the distal surfaces of the adjacent tooth except the maxillary and mandibular central incisors (both permanent and deciduous).\n\nDivision of the crown into thirds\nSo, for description, the crown and the root are divided into thirds according to the position of the surface."
