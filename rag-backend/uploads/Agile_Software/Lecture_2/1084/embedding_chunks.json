The manifesto had four \ncore values and is discussed in the next section.\n○\nAlong with the Agile Manifesto, the experts also agreed on twelve detailed \nstatements that further explains agility.\n\nFour Core Values of the Agile Manifesto\nThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development states:\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and \nhelping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:\n1.\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n2.\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n3.\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n4.\nResponding to change over following a plan\nThat is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items \non the left more."

    "text": "Four Core Values of the Agile Manifesto\n\n1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools\n●\nThis value emphasizes the people in the team and the interactions within \nthem rather than a heavy-process mindset and an armory of project \nmanagement tools.\n○\nThe value doesn’t say that processes are an overhead or cannot help \nin delivering projects, nor does it say that Agile projects (of any scale) \nare completely devoid of processes and tools\n○\nThis value states that processes and tools might be helpful, but without \neffective collaboration between individuals in an Agile project team \ndelivery is not possible\n○\nAgile teams are empowered to tailor the process based on what they \nconsider as essential in the specific context of their project (and the \norganization) and evolve the same through periodic introspection\n\nPros and Cons\nPros Individuals and Interactions Have High Value\n●\nCommunication is quick, clear  and effective.\n●\nTeamwork becomes strong as people work \ntogether.\n●\nDevelopment teams can self-organize.\n●\nDevelopment teams have more chances to \ninnovate.\n●\nDevelopment teams can customize processes \nas necessary.\nCons:\n●\nDevelopment team members must have the \ncapacity to be involved, responsible, and \ninnovative.\n●\nPeople may need to let go of ego to work well \nas members of a team.\nPros Processes and Tools Have High Value\n●\nProcesses are clear and can be easy to \nfollow.\n●\nWritten records of communication exist\nCons:\n●\nPeople may over-rely on processes \ninstead of finding the best ways to \ncreate good products.\n●\nOne process doesn’t fit all teams —\ndifferent people have different work \nstyles.\n●\nOne process doesn’t fit all projects.\n●\nCommunication can be ambiguous and \ntime-consuming."

    "text": "2. Working software over comprehensive documentation\n●\nThis value reminds us that until the software is delivered to production, then \nit's carry on value to the customer.\n●\nThis has a few anticipated problems though, as mentioned below:\n○\nIt is almost impossible for a person to initially specify exactly how a \nscreen should look like or be perceived by an end user.\n○\nIn reality, end users can change their minds frequently, so keeping up-\nto-date documentation is a challenging and costly affair.\n○\nIf more some reason the project is terminated in the middle of the \nproject, what will be left behind is a pile of documents that yields no \nvalue to the end user\n\nIdentifying Useful Documentation\nDocument\nDoes the Document Support Product \nDevelopment?\nIs the Document Barely Sufficient or Gold-\nPlated?\nProject schedule created \nwith expensive project \nmanagement software, \ncomplete with Gantt Chart.\nNo.\nStart-to-finish schedules with detailed tasks \nand dates tend to provide more than what is \nnecessary for product development. Also, \nmany of these details change before you \ndevelop future features.\nGold-plated\nAlthough project managers might spend a \nlot of time creating and updating project \nschedules, project team members tend to \nwant to know only key deliverable dates. \nManagement often wants to know only \nwhether the project is on time, ahead of \nschedule, or behind.\nRequirements \ndocumentation.\nYes\nAll projects have requirements — details \nabout product features and needs. \nDevelopment teams need to know those \nneeds to create a product.\nPossibly gold-plated; should be barely \nsufficient.\nRequirements documents can easily grow to \ninclude unnecessary details. Agile \napproaches provide simple ways to describe \nproduct requirements."

Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation\n●\nThis value focuses on building a relationship based on trust that spans across \norganization boundaries between the customer and the vendor or service \nprovider of the software\n●\nThe contracts are rigid, in the sense that both sides are coerced (or legally \nbound) to obey the elements of scope, time and cost \n●\nApprovals of such change controls take a long time and at times, could make \nthe progress frustratingly slow.\n●\nRather than negotiating with the customer on the scope and enforcing rigorous \nchange management techniques, it is in the interest of both the customer and \nthe vendor to collaborate, be flexible and drive toward a common goal.\n●\n“Good collaboration can sometimes make a contract unnecessary” [Alistair \nCockburn]\n\n4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan\n●\nThe value embodies the fact that Agile acknowledges and embraces change \nand not treat that as an exception.\n●\nTraditional projects invest a substantial effort in developing a detailed project \nplan, consisting of detailed schedules, allocation and critical paths. And in the \nevent of a change, re-planning and re-baselining needs to be done to make \nsure that the plan is up to date and reflects the changes.\n●\nIn the case of Agile projects, upfront detailed planning is considered \ncounterproductive and inefficient because of the uncertainties involved. A fair \namount of planning happens just in time or at the last responsible moment\n●\nThis means that the work items for the upcoming iteration is well detailed out \nand the others are left coarse-grained"
