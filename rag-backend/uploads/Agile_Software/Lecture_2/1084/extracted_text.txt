Rapid software development
Why?
Need to react to changes more quickly than 2 year long waterfall projects
2 years and then you got the design wrong anyway! Small deliveries aren't 
abstract
How?
Goal - Deliver working software quickly
• Compromise - less functionality in a delivery, not lower quality
• Less documentation
Focus on the code rather than the design
Interleave
• Specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved
Deliver small versions and get user (stakeholder) input

Agility and the Cost of Change




The Agile Manifesto
●
On February 11-13, 2001, The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in Utah witnessed a 
meeting between seventeen advocates of lightweight methodologies, seeking to 
discuss and identify any common ground for software development:
○
The word “Agile” was chosen to lay emphasis on ways that software 
development is expected to react to changing business circumstances.
○
The seventeen attendees formed a group and christened themselves as “The 
Agile Alliance.”
○
Each of the experts spent time listening to others and presenting their nuggets 
of wisdom based on their individual experiences that started several years ago 
before this meeting was decided.
○
The Agile Software Development Manifesto emerged. The manifesto had four 
core values and is discussed in the next section.
○
Along with the Agile Manifesto, the experts also agreed on twelve detailed 
statements that further explains agility.


Four Core Values of the Agile Manifesto
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development states:
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and 
helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
1.
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.
Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items 
on the left more.


Four Core Values of the Agile Manifesto


1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
●
This value emphasizes the people in the team and the interactions within 
them rather than a heavy-process mindset and an armory of project 
management tools.
○
The value doesn’t say that processes are an overhead or cannot help 
in delivering projects, nor does it say that Agile projects (of any scale) 
are completely devoid of processes and tools
○
This value states that processes and tools might be helpful, but without 
effective collaboration between individuals in an Agile project team 
delivery is not possible
○
Agile teams are empowered to tailor the process based on what they 
consider as essential in the specific context of their project (and the 
organization) and evolve the same through periodic introspection


Pros and Cons
Pros Individuals and Interactions Have High Value
●
Communication is quick, clear  and effective.
●
Teamwork becomes strong as people work 
together.
●
Development teams can self-organize.
●
Development teams have more chances to 
innovate.
●
Development teams can customize processes 
as necessary.
Cons:
●
Development team members must have the 
capacity to be involved, responsible, and 
innovative.
●
People may need to let go of ego to work well 
as members of a team.
Pros Processes and Tools Have High Value
●
Processes are clear and can be easy to 
follow.
●
Written records of communication exist
Cons:
●
People may over-rely on processes 
instead of finding the best ways to 
create good products.
●
One process doesn’t fit all teams —
different people have different work 
styles.
●
One process doesn’t fit all projects.
●
Communication can be ambiguous and 
time-consuming.


2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
●
This value reminds us that until the software is delivered to production, then 
it's carry on value to the customer.
●
This has a few anticipated problems though, as mentioned below:
○
It is almost impossible for a person to initially specify exactly how a 
screen should look like or be perceived by an end user.
○
In reality, end users can change their minds frequently, so keeping up-
to-date documentation is a challenging and costly affair.
○
If more some reason the project is terminated in the middle of the 
project, what will be left behind is a pile of documents that yields no 
value to the end user


Identifying Useful Documentation
Document
Does the Document Support Product 
Development?
Is the Document Barely Sufficient or Gold-
Plated?
Project schedule created 
with expensive project 
management software, 
complete with Gantt Chart.
No.
Start-to-finish schedules with detailed tasks 
and dates tend to provide more than what is 
necessary for product development. Also, 
many of these details change before you 
develop future features.
Gold-plated
Although project managers might spend a 
lot of time creating and updating project 
schedules, project team members tend to 
want to know only key deliverable dates. 
Management often wants to know only 
whether the project is on time, ahead of 
schedule, or behind.
Requirements 
documentation.
Yes
All projects have requirements — details 
about product features and needs. 
Development teams need to know those 
needs to create a product.
Possibly gold-plated; should be barely 
sufficient.
Requirements documents can easily grow to 
include unnecessary details. Agile 
approaches provide simple ways to describe 
product requirements.


Identifying Useful Documentation (2)
Document
Does the Document Support Product 
Development?
Is the Document Barely Sufficient or Gold-
Plated?
Weekly status report.
No.
Documenting how you created a product 
can make future changes easier.
Gold-plated
Knowing project status is helpful, but 
traditional status reports contain outdated 
information and are much more burdensome 
than necessary.
Product technical 
specifications.
Yes
All projects have requirements — details 
about product features and needs. 
Development teams need to know those 
needs to create a product.
Possibly gold-plated; should be barely 
sufficient.
Agile documentation includes just what it 
needs — development teams often don’t 
have time for extra flourishes and are keen to 
minimize documentation.
On agile projects:
- Documents are useful only if they support product development and are barely sufficient to serve for particular purpose 
(delivery, deployment, ...)
- administrative paperwork relating to time, cost control, scope control, or reporting.


3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
●
This value focuses on building a relationship based on trust that spans across 
organization boundaries between the customer and the vendor or service 
provider of the software
●
The contracts are rigid, in the sense that both sides are coerced (or legally 
bound) to obey the elements of scope, time and cost 
●
Approvals of such change controls take a long time and at times, could make 
the progress frustratingly slow.
●
Rather than negotiating with the customer on the scope and enforcing rigorous 
change management techniques, it is in the interest of both the customer and 
the vendor to collaborate, be flexible and drive toward a common goal.
●
“Good collaboration can sometimes make a contract unnecessary” [Alistair 
Cockburn]




4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan
●
The value embodies the fact that Agile acknowledges and embraces change 
and not treat that as an exception.
●
Traditional projects invest a substantial effort in developing a detailed project 
plan, consisting of detailed schedules, allocation and critical paths. And in the 
event of a change, re-planning and re-baselining needs to be done to make 
sure that the plan is up to date and reflects the changes.
●
In the case of Agile projects, upfront detailed planning is considered 
counterproductive and inefficient because of the uncertainties involved. A fair 
amount of planning happens just in time or at the last responsible moment
●
This means that the work items for the upcoming iteration is well detailed out 
and the others are left coarse-grained






The 12 Agile Principles 
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous 
delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes 
harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of 
months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the 
project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and 
support they need and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within 
a development team is face-to-face conversation.


The 12 Agile Principles (2)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, 
developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances 
agility.
10.Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11.The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-
organizing teams.
12.At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then 
tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


The 12 Agile Principles Explained
●
These agile principles provide 
practical guidance for 
development teams.
●
Another way of organizing the 
12 principles is to consider them 
in the following four distinct 
groups:
○
Customer satisfaction
○
Quality
○
Communicate & Teamwork
○
Project management


The Agile principles of customer satisfaction
●
Agile approaches focus on customer satisfaction, which makes sense. After all, 
the customer is the reason for developing the product in the first place.
○
principles 1, 2, 3, and 4 stand out for us
●
How do you enact these principles? 
○
Agile project teams include a product owner, a person who is responsible for 
ensuring translation of what the customer wants into product requirements
○
The product owner prioritizing product features (called Backlog) to the development 
team. The development team delivers the most valuable features on the list in short 
cycles of development, known as iterations or sprints.
○
The product owner has deep and ongoing involvement throughout each day to 
clarify priorities and requirements, make decisions, provide feedback, and quickly 
answer the many questions that pop up during a project.
○
Frequent delivery of working functionality allows the product owner and the 
customer to have a full sense of how the product is developing.


The Agile principles of customer satisfaction (2)
●
As the development team continues to deliver complete, working, 
potentially shippable functionality every four to eight weeks or 
less, the value of the total product grows incrementally, as do its 
functional capabilities.
●
The customer accumulates value for his or her investment 
regularly by receiving new, ready-to-use functionality throughout 
the project, rather than waiting until the end of what might be a 
long project for the first, and maybe only, delivery of releasable 
product features.


Customer Dissatisfaction and How Agile Might Help


The Agile principles of quality
●
An agile project team commits to producing quality in every product it creates 
— from development through documentation to integration and test results —
every day
●
Each project team member contributes his or her best work all the time.
●
principles 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 stand out for us
●
Agile approaches provide the following strategies for quality management: 
○
Defining what done means at the beginning of the project and then using that 
definition as a benchmark for quality
○
Testing aggressively and daily through automated means
○
Building only the functionality that is needed when it’s needed
○
Reviewing the software code and streamlining (refactoring)
○
Showcasing to stakeholders and customers only the functionality that has been 
accepted by the product owner
○
Having multiple feedback points throughout the day, iteration, and project


The Agile principles of communication and teamwork
●
Teamwork is critical to agile projects. 
●
Creating good products requires cooperation among all the members of the 
project team, including customers and stakeholders.
●
They know that meeting with users more often keeps them in sync, and 
actually prevents those changes.
●
Agile approaches support team-building and teamwork, and they emphasize 
trust in self-managing development teams
●
Principles 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12 stand out for us as supporting team 
empowerment, efficiency, and excellence


The Agile principles of communication and teamwork (2)
●
The following strategies promote effective teamwork:
○
Place the development team in the same location — this is called collocation
○
Put together a physical environment that’s conducive for collaboration: a team room 
with whiteboards, colored pens, and other tactile tools for developing and conveying 
ideas to ensure shared understanding.
○
Create an environment where project team members are encouraged to speak their 
minds. When everyone is trusted and given a good working environment, they 
flourish.
○
Meet face-to-face whenever possible. Don’t send an email if a conversation can 
handle the issue.
○
Get clarifications throughout the day as they’re needed.
○
Encourage the development team to solve problems rather than having managers 
solve problems for the development team.


The Agile principles of project management
●
An agile approach focuses on planning and executing the work to produce the 
best product that can be released. 
●
The approach is supported by communicating openly, avoiding distractions and 
wasteful activities, and ensuring that the progress of the project is clear to 
everyone.
●
Principles 2, 8, and 10 stand out for us:
●
Project management is facilitated by the following agile approaches:
○
Supporting the development team
○
Producing barely sufficient documents
○
Streamlining status reporting so that information is pushed out by the development 
team in seconds rather than pulled out by a project manager over a longer period of 
time


The Agile principles of project management (2)
o
Minimizing non-development tasks
o
Setting expectations that change is normal and beneficial, not something 
to be feared or evaded
o
Adopting a just-in-time requirements to minimize change disruption and 
wasted effort
o
Collaborating with the development team to create realistic schedules, 
targets, and goals
o
Protecting the development team from organizational disruptions that 
could undermine project goals by introducing work not relevant to the 
project objectives
o
Understanding that an appropriate balance between work and life is a 
component of efficient development


Agile Project Management
●
Agile project management is a style of project management that 
focuses on early delivery of business value, continuous improvement 
of the project’s product and processes, scope flexibility, team input, 
and delivering well-tested products that reflect customer needs.
●
Unlike more traditional project management techniques, which focus 
on achieving identifiable milestones using complex scheduling tools 
like Gantt charts, Agile management is an iterative, incremental 
process.

Contrasting Historical Project Management with Agile 
Project Management


Agile Principle over Practices
Some of the principles or culture changes that are the harder parts 
of Agile
●
Communication
○
I often see people using the Scrum Master to deliver their messages to others.
○
Help your teams get into the habit of communicating face-to-face as their first option 
instead of as a last resort.  Wasted time is not Agile.
●
Collaboration:
○
Agile is all about people working together, talking together and coming up with great 
ideas together
○
Great Agile teams are not managed – they’re encouraged to collaborate and figure 
things out themselves.  
○
Often, the lesson is learned better by experience (good or bad) than by being told 
what to do.
○
Product owners to get involved with the project team regularly throughout the sprint


Agile Principle over Practices (2)
●
Transparency
○
Transparency is just being honest – telling it like it is and sometimes being 
vulnerable
○
We can’t fix things if problems are swept under the rug.
○
encourage teams to make work more visible by putting large paper Scrum boards 
and burn-down charts on a wall and showcasing this information to everyone 
around them
○
Agile team members are reluctant to raise obstacles during stand-up meetings. 
Scrum Master is to remove obstacles so the team can focus on delivering software.
○
Reward those who speak up and raise obstacles in the first few sprints, especially 
the quieter people, by recognizing them in front of the team.
●
Retrospection:
○
some Agile teams skip sprint retrospectives because they think they don’t have time 
or they don’t see the value of doing them
●
Simplicity:
○
This can be one of the harder parts of Agile.
○
Artifacts should be minimized to only what’s really needed to get the job done.


From Traditional to Agile


From Traditional to Agile


Agile Vs. Traditional
Agile:
•
Building off close collaboration 
with one customer.
•
Getting a product with 
significant value out faster.
•
Building with a small team 
working closely together.
•
Iterative delivery by a single 
organization who come to have 
the knowledge in their heads.
•
What’s important can only be 
discovered incrementally.
•
What’s a “perfect example” of 
an Agile-friendly project?
Non Agile:
•
Building a general product to 
address a wide customer base.
•
Building off standards and 
consistent design principles.
•
Managing a large project with 
lots of interdependent pieces.
•
Product releases over a long 
period of time, by rotating staff 
who rely on documentation. 
•
Goals and rules well known at 
the start.
•
What’s a “perfect example” of 
an Old-school-friendly project?
Do it when the cost of rework is low. 
Dealing with things “ad hoc” mostly 
works. We call it “refactoring.”
Do it when the cost of rework is high.  
Big surprises would be awful. We’d be 
starting over.

Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

How Agile Approaches Can Increase Customer Satisfaction

Examples of Customer
Dissatisfaction with Projects

Product owners work closely with the customer to define and refine
product requirements and provide clarity to the development team.

Agile project teams demonstrate and deliver working functionality at
regular intervals. If a product doesn’t work the way the customer
thinks it should work, the customer is able to provide feedback at the
end of the sprint, not before it’s too late at the end of the project.

Working in sprints allows agile project teams to deliver high-priority
functionality early and often.

Agile processes are built for change. Development teams can
accommodate new requirements, requirement updates, and shifting
priorities with each sprint, offsetting the cost of these changes by
removing the lowest-priority requirements — functionality that likely
will never or rarely get used.

The product requirements were
misunderstood by the
development team.

The product wasn't delivered when
the customer needed it.

The customer can't request
changes without additional
cost and time.

Agile Approach to the Project Management Task

Create a product backlog — a simple list of requirements by
priority. Quickly update the product backlog as requirements
and priorities change throughout the project.

The development team meets quickly, for no longer than

15 minutes, at the start of each day to coordinate and
synchronize that day's work and any roadblocks. They can
update the centrally visible burndown chart in under a minute
at the end of each day.

Work within sprints and identify only specific tasks for the
active sprint.

Support the development team by helping remove
impediments and distractions. On agile projects, development
teams define and pull (as opposed to push) their own tasks.

Traditional Project Management Tasks

Create a fully detailed project requirement
document at the beginning of the project.
Try to control requirement changes
throughout the project.

Conduct weekly status meetings with all
project stakeholders and developers. Send
out detailed meeting notes and status
reports after each meeting.

Create a detailed project schedule with all
tasks at the beginning of the project. Try to
keep the project tasks on schedule. Update
the schedule on a regular basis.

Assign tasks to the development team.
