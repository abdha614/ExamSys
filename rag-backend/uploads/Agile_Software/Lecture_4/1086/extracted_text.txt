What is an Agile Project?
• Simple answer:  A Project that uses Agile Principles and 
Practices
• But what are those characteristics?
– Being able to measure ROI early and often in the project
– Transparent to the organization – high visibility of project 
progress and issues
– Continuous involvement of stakeholders (customers) in 
throughout the project
– The business owner is empowered to make decisions to meet 
goals
– Adaptive – able to change to meet needs and requirements as 
they present themselves
– Always looking for ways to reduce waste and target the 
minimum set of customer value
• Reduce waste of both the product and the process

An Agile Process
•
Is driven by customer descriptions of what is required (scenarios)
•
Recognizes that plans are short-lived
•
Develops software iteratively with a heavy emphasis on construction 
activities
•
Delivers multiple ‘software increments’
•
Adapts as changes occur

Problems with agile methods
It can be difficult to keep the interest of customers / users who are involved in the 
process.
Team members may be unsuited to the intense involvement that characterizes agile 
methods.
Prioritizing changes can be difficult where there are multiple stakeholders.
Maintaining simplicity requires extra work.
Contracts may be a problem as with other approaches to iterative development.
Because of their focus on small, tightly-integrated teams, there are problems in 
scaling agile methods to large systems. 
Less emphasis on documentation - harder to maintain when you get a new team for 
maintenance

Extreme Programming (XP)
The most widely used agile process, originally proposed by Kent Beck 2004.
Extreme Programming (XP) takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development. 

New versions may be built several times per day;

Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks;

All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run 
successfully.
Customer involvement means full-time customer engagement with the team. -
Specifications through user stories broken into tasks
People not process :  pair programming, collective ownership and a process that 
avoids long working hours.
Regular system releases. - release set of user stories
Maintaining simplicity through constant refactoring of code.

XP Values


XP Values - Communication
•
Everyone is a member of the team: project managers, developers, testers. 
They constantly communicate with each other and with the customer. 
There’s a daily standup meeting for status updates. The aim is to avoid 
surprises and identify issues quickly.
•
The customer gets frequent updates on progress. This is a consistent 
practice throughout the entire development cycle. Customers find out from 
the beginning what’s happening, not just when there’s something ready for 
them to test.
•
Communication may take the form of “pair programming,” one of XP’s most 
controversial ideas. The idea is that two people work at the same computer, 
checking each other’s work. Making a success of this requires the right 
personalities.


XP Values - Simplicity
• Keeping the steps simple is one of XP’s most distinctive 
features. 
• A project starts with the simplest design possible. 
• The process starts with a few lines of code that do something. 
• Tasks are broken into small pieces, and functionality is added a 
bit at a time.
• Instead of submitting a requirements document, the customer 
provides user stories. They don’t have to be full technical 
descriptions, just to say what needs to get done. 
• The developers will work from that to create something. If the 
customer doesn’t like it, they’ll talk about what needs changing.


XP Values - Feedback
• Communication and feedback are closely related. 
• The team is always focused on the customer’s needs. It provides 
usable code as frequently as possible and responds to customer 
reactions. 
• Instead of finding out months later that it should have done 
something differently, it gets feedback within days or even the 
same day. 
• Since each piece is kept simple, changing how it works isn’t 
onerous.


XP Values - Respect
• Everyone on the team is a contributor. Everyone gets listened 
to. Ideas get a hearing, even if they may seem silly at first. Ideas 
are evaluated by their worth, not by the seniority of the person 
presenting them.
• The customer gets respect too. This can be hard when the 
demands seem arbitrary and excessive, but the tight feedback 
cycle helps avoid stress.
• Requests for change will come early in the cycle, before the 
team has invested too much effort and pride in making things 
work a certain way.


XP Values - Courage
• Respect and courage on a team go hand in hand. Everyone 
takes responsibility, and people don’t fake progress. 
• If there’s a problem, the people responsible own up to it. They 
don’t get blasted, but they’re expected to do what’s necessary 
to fix it. This can include asking for help.
• Courage can mean discarding a bad idea or a bad piece of code.
• The aim is to meet the customer’s needs, not to prop up sunk 
costs. 
• Trying out a new approach is sometimes the best way to deal 
with a persistent problem.


XP Methodology


Planning/feedback Loops


The XP Process


Extreme Programming (XP) – Pair Programming
In XP, programmers work in pairs, sitting together to develop code.
Common ownership
Knowledge spread
Informal review
Refactoring
Similar output to two people coding


Scrum
• Originally proposed by Schwaber and Beedle
• Scrum—distinguishing features
– Development work is partitioned into “packets”
– Testing and documentation are on-going as the product is 
constructed
– Work occurs in “sprints” and is derived from a “backlog” of 
existing requirements
– Meetings are very short and sometimes conducted without 
chairs
– “demos” are delivered to the customer with the time-box 
allocated


Scrum
Project Manager's job: - Deliver needed system on time within 
budget 
The Scrum approach - manage the iterations
There are three phases in Scrum. 
Outline planning phase - general picture and architecture
Sprint cycles releasing increments of the system. 
The project closure phase - final delivery, documentation and 
review of lessons learned. 


Scrum – The Process


Scrum - The Sprint cycle
Every 2–4 weeks (a fixed length).  
1) Project team with customer: Look at product 
backlog - select stories to implement
2) Implement with all customer communication 
through scrum master
Scrum master has project manager role during sprint
Daily 15 min meetings 
Stand up often
Team presents progress and impediments
Scrum master tasked with removing impediments
3) Review system release with user


Scrum - Benefits
The product is broken down into a set of manageable and 
understandable chunks.
Unstable requirements do not hold up progress.
The whole team have visibility of everything and consequently team 
communication is improved.
Customers see on-time delivery of increments and gain feedback on 
how the product works.
Trust between customers and developers is established and a positive 
culture is created in which everyone expects the project to succeed.


Adaptive Software Development
• Originally proposed by Jim Highsmith
• ASD — distinguishing  features
– Mission-driven planning
– Component-based focus
– Uses “time-boxing”
– Explicit consideration of risks
– Emphasizes collaboration for requirements gathering
– Emphasizes “learning” throughout the process


Adaptive Software Development


Three Phases of ASD 
1. Speculation: 
– Project is initiated and adaptive cycle planning is 
conducted.
– Adaptive cycle planning uses project initiation 
information- the customer’s mission statement, 
project constraints (e.g. delivery date), and basic 
requirements to define the set of release cycles 
(increments) that will be required for the project. 
– Based on the information obtained at the 
completion of the first cycle, the plan is reviewed 
and adjusted so that planned work better fits the 
reality.

2. Collaborations are used to multiply their talent and 
creative output beyond absolute number . It 
encompasses communication and teamwork, but it also 
emphasizes individualism, because individual creativity 
plays an important role in collaborative thinking. 
Three Phases of ASD 


3. Learning: 
• As members of ASD team begin to develop the 
components, the emphasis is on “learning”.
• Highsmith argues that software developers 
often overestimate their own understanding of 
the technology, the process, and the project 
and that learning will help them to improve 
their level of real understanding. 
• Three ways:
– focus groups, 
– technical reviews 
– project postmortems. 
29
Three Phases of ASD 


Dynamic Systems Development Method
• Promoted by the DSDM Consortium (www.dsdm.org)
• DSDM—distinguishing features
–Similar in most respects to XP and/or ASD


Dynamic Systems Development Method

Feature Driven Development
• Originally proposed by Peter Coad et al
• FDD—distinguishing features
– Emphasis is on defining “features”
• a feature “is a client-valued function that can be 
implemented in two weeks or less.”
– Uses a feature template
•
<action> the <result> <by | for | of | to> a(n) <object>
– A features list is created and “plan by feature” is 
conducted
– Design and construction merge in FDD


33
Feature Driven Development


34
Feature Driven Development Process
1.
Creating a Domain object model using object modeling 
with their domain experts.
2.
Developers use the information from Object Modeling and 
other activities and goes on to create a feature list.
3.
A rough plan is prepared based on features and roles, and 
responsibilities are assigned.
4.
Small features or features of feature, whatever takes less 
than two weeks, are taken up.
5.
Designing and coding for each feature happen. It is the 
construction phase for that feature.
