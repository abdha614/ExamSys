    "title": "Extreme Programming (XP): Overview and Values",
    "text": "Extreme Programming (XP)\nThe most widely used agile process, originally proposed by Kent Beck 2004.\nExtreme Programming (XP) takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development. \n New versions may be built several times per day;\n Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks;\n All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully.\nCustomer involvement means full-time customer engagement with the team. - Specifications through user stories broken into tasks\nPeople not process :  pair programming, collective ownership and a process that avoids long working hours.\nRegular system releases. - release set of user stories\nMaintaining simplicity through constant refactoring of code.\n\nXP Values\n\nXP Values - Communication\n• Everyone is a member of the team: project managers, developers, testers. They constantly communicate with each other and with the customer. There’s a daily standup meeting for status updates. The aim is to avoid surprises and identify issues quickly.\n• The customer gets frequent updates on progress. This is a consistent practice throughout the entire development cycle. Customers find out from the beginning what’s happening, not just when there’s something ready for them to test.\n• Communication may take the form of “pair programming,” one of XP’s most controversial ideas. The idea is that two people work at the same computer, checking each other’s work. Making a success of this requires the right personalities.\n\nXP Values - Simplicity\n• Keeping the steps simple is one of XP’s most distinctive features. \n• A project starts with the simplest design possible. \n• The process starts with a few lines of code that do something. \n• Tasks are broken into small pieces, and functionality is added a bit at a time.\n• Instead of submitting a requirements document, the customer provides user stories. They don’t have to be full technical descriptions, just to say what needs to get done. \n• The developers will work from that to create something. If the customer doesn’t like it, they’ll talk about what needs changing."

    "title": "Extreme Programming (XP): Feedback, Respect, Courage, and Methodology",
    "text": "XP Values - Feedback\n• Communication and feedback are closely related. \n• The team is always focused on the customer’s needs. It provides usable code as frequently as possible and responds to customer reactions. \n• Instead of finding out months later that it should have done something differently, it gets feedback within days or even the same day. \n• Since each piece is kept simple, changing how it works isn’t onerous.\n\nXP Values - Respect\n• Everyone on the team is a contributor. Everyone gets listened to. Ideas get a hearing, even if they may seem silly at first. Ideas are evaluated by their worth, not by the seniority of the person presenting them.\n• The customer gets respect too. This can be hard when the demands seem arbitrary and excessive, but the tight feedback cycle helps avoid stress.\n• Requests for change will come early in the cycle, before the team has invested too much effort and pride in making things work a certain way.\n\nXP Values - Courage\n• Respect and courage on a team go hand in hand. Everyone takes responsibility, and people don’t fake progress. \n• If there’s a problem, the people responsible own up to it. They don’t get blasted, but they’re expected to do what’s necessary to fix it. This can include asking for help.\n• Courage can mean discarding a bad idea or a bad piece of code.\n• The aim is to meet the customer’s needs, not to prop up sunk costs. \n• Trying out a new approach is sometimes the best way to deal with a persistent problem.\n\nXP Methodology\n\nPlanning/feedback Loops\n\nThe XP Process\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) – Pair Programming\nIn XP, programmers work in pairs, sitting together to develop code.\nCommon ownership\nKnowledge spread\nInformal review\nRefactoring\nSimilar output to two people coding"

    "title": "Adaptive Software Development (ASD): Overview and Phases",
    "text": "Adaptive Software Development\n• Originally proposed by Jim Highsmith\n• ASD — distinguishing  features\n– Mission-driven planning\n– Component-based focus\n– Uses “time-boxing”\n– Explicit consideration of risks\n– Emphasizes collaboration for requirements gathering\n– Emphasizes “learning” throughout the process\n\nAdaptive Software Development\n\nThree Phases of ASD \n1. Speculation: \n– Project is initiated and adaptive cycle planning is conducted.\n– Adaptive cycle planning uses project initiation information- the customer’s mission statement, project constraints (e.g. delivery date), and basic requirements to define the set of release cycles (increments) that will be required for the project. \n– Based on the information obtained at the completion of the first cycle, the plan is reviewed and adjusted so that planned work better fits the reality. \n\n2. Collaborations are used to multiply their talent and creative output beyond absolute number . It encompasses communication and teamwork, but it also emphasizes individualism, because individual creativity plays an important role in collaborative thinking. \nThree Phases of ASD \n\n3. Learning: \n• As members of ASD team begin to develop the components, the emphasis is on “learning”.\n• Highsmith argues that software developers often overestimate their own understanding of the technology, the process, and the project and that learning will help them to improve their level of real understanding. \n• Three ways:\n– focus groups, \n– technical reviews \n– project postmortems."

Designing and coding for each feature happen. It is the construction phase for that feature."
