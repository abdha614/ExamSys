Sprints
•
Scrum projects make progress in a series of “sprints”
–
Analogous to Extreme Programming iterations
•
Typical duration is 2–4 weeks or a calendar month at 
most
•
A constant duration leads to a better rhythm
•
Product is designed, coded, and tested during the 
sprint
7
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


No changes during a sprint
• Plan sprint durations around how long you can 
commit to keeping change out of the sprint

Sprint Planning Mtg.
Sprint planning meeting
Sprint prioritization
• Analyze/evaluate product 
backlog
• Select sprint goal
Sprint planning
• Decide how to achieve sprint goal 
(design)
• Create sprint backlog (tasks) from 
product backlog items (user 
stories / features)
• Estimate sprint backlog in hours

16
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Sprint Planning
• Team selects items from the product backlog they 
can commit to completing
• Sprint backlog is created
– Tasks are identified and each is estimated (1-16 hours)
– Collaboratively, not done alone by the ScrumMaster
• High-level design is considered
As a vacation planner, I want to see 
photos of the hotels.
Code the middle tier (8 hours)
Code the user interface (4)
Write test fixtures (4)
Code the foo class (6)
Update performance tests (4)
17
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


The Sprint Review
• Team presents what it accomplished during the 
sprint
• Typically takes the form of a demo of new features or 
underlying architecture
• Informal
– 2-hour prep time rule
– No slides
• Whole team participates
• Invite the world
18
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Sprint retrospective
• Periodically take a look at what is and is not working
• Typically 15–30 minutes
• Done after every sprint
• Whole team participates
–
ScrumMaster
–
Product owner
–
Team
–
Possibly customers and others
19
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Start / Stop / Continue
• Whole team gathers and discusses what they’d 
like to:
Start doing
Stop doing
Continue doing
This is just one 
of many ways 
to do a sprint 
retrospective.

Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Daily SCRUM Meeting
•
Parameters
–
Daily, ~15 minutes, Stand-up
–
Anyone late pays a $1 fee
•
Not for problem solving
–
Whole world is invited
–
Only team members, Scrum Master, product owner, can talk
–
Helps avoid other unnecessary meetings
•
Three questions answered by each team member:
1.
What did you do yesterday?
2.
What will you do today?
3.
What obstacles are in your way?

Scrum's Artifacts
• Scrum has remarkably few artifacts
– Product Backlog
– Sprint Backlog
– Burndown Charts
• Can be managed using just an Excel spreadsheet
– More advanced / complicated tools exist:
• Expensive
• Web-based – no good for Scrum Master/project manager who 
travels
• Still under development
23
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Product Backlog
•
The requirements
•
A list of all desired work on project
•
Ideally expressed as a list of user 
stories along with "story points", 
such that each item has value to 
users or customers of the product 
•
Prioritized by the product owner
•
Reprioritized at start of each sprint
This is the
product backlog
24
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


• The Product Backlog has no end – it is never finished 
unless the activity is not longer needed
• The Product Backlog should be groomed on a regular 
cadence
• The Product Backlog evolves to meet the Feedback 
received from customers and the marketplace
The Product Backlog Lifecycle
New Items
Released 
Elements
25
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Building a backlog
•
The Backlog is made 
up of a hierarchy of 
Epics →Features →
Stories
•
Decompose an Epic 
into Features
•
Decompose 
Features into 
Stories in 
preparation for 
Sprint Planning
26
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


A deeper view of the Product Backlog
•
Owned and 
prioritized by 
the Product 
Owner
•
Anyone in the 
Org can add to 
the backlog
•
Discipline:  “If it 
is not on the 
backlog it 
doesn’t exist 
27
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Backlog grooming based on Team velocity 
28
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


User Stories
• Instead of Use Cases, Agile project owners do "user stories"
– Who (user role) – Is this a customer, employee, admin, etc.?
– What (goal) – What functionality must be achieved/developed? 
– Why (reason) – Why does user want to accomplish this goal?
As a [user role], I want to [goal], so I can [reason].
• Example:
– "As a user, I want to log in, so I can access subscriber content."
• story points: Rating of effort needed to implement this 
story
– common scales: 1-10, shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL), etc.
29
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


User Stories and the Backlog
• ROLE – is the user of the element
• GOAL – is what they want to accomplish
• BENEFIT – is the business value it provides
Describes the value from a users perspective of the value of the 
element to be developed
The backlog is a collection of Stories that are arranged in priority 
order by value 
Description – details of the story, technical, logistic, timing, etc.
Acceptance Criteria”
• Give – initial condition
• When – stimulus
• Then – Final condition

30
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


• As a consumer, I want shopping cart functionality to 
easily purchase items online.
• As an executive, I want to generate a report to 
understand which departments need to improve their 
productivity.
• As a developer, I want to publish the current state of 
my application to an update set, so that I can deploy it 
to a production system.
• As a customer, I want to receive notifications when an 
incident is commented, so that I am updated on the 
status.
• As a change manager, I want to enable the assessment 
of risk for any given change by establishing a list of 
questions with multiple choice answers.
User Story Examples
31
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


• First embrace that new requirements will be coming in as we 
progress through the project/program
• Review the business value of each new Feature or Story to 
ensure the highest business value
• Ensure that we are not over-specifying or adding extra 
features that add to wasted time and effort for which the 
customer or marketplace in not willing to pay
• Groom the backlog on a cadence so that new requirements 
can be added and the backlog order reprioritized
Given that we have Emerging Requirements what do we do?
32
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Method for determining an effective Story
• Able to be build in any order
Independent
• Make tradeoffs with Stakeholders
Negotiable
• If there is no value, then it is a waste
Valuable
• There is enough information to estimate the 
effort
Estimable
• Small enough to be estimable
Small
• Without testing there is no knowledge of 
achievement: Given, When, Then
Testable
33
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


•
Develop a single priority list which has the order of importance 
visible in the ranking
•
Using this method provided a means for adding, subtracting or 
changing order as new information is provided
•
It clearly shows the relative priority of one element to another
Relative Priority to achieve a singularity
34
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


• Perform a risk analysis on the backlog to determine 
items that need to be learned early in the 
development cycle
– Move the most risky element up in priority
• Review the backlog to see what technology items 
must be completed before business items
• Backlogs can be adjusted by 
ROI or Risk calculations
Risk/Technology adjusting a Backlog

The Sprint Goal
• A short statement of what the work will be focused on during 
the sprint
Make the application run on 
SQL Server in addition to 
Oracle.
Database Application
Financial services
Life Sciences
Support features necessary for 
population genetics studies.
Support more technical 
indicators than company ABC 
with real-time, streaming data.
38
Agile Software Development – Syrian Private University – Instructor: Dr. Mouhib Alnoukari


Managing the sprint backlog
• Individuals sign up for work of their own choosing
– Work is never assigned
• Estimated work remaining is updated daily
• Any team member can add, delete or change the 
sprint backlog
• Work for the sprint emerges
• If work is unclear, define a sprint backlog item 
with a larger amount of time and break it down 
later
• Update work remaining as more becomes known
