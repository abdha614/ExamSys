Raghad al-hossny\n\nObject-oriented programming OOP pillars: \nThe four pillars of object-oriented \nprogramming (OOP) are abstraction, \nencapsulation, inheritance, and \npolymorphism. These principles help \norganize and manage complex code by \nusing objects to interact with each other \nthrough a set of core ideas that promote \ncode reuse, flexibility, and modularity.\n\nAbstraction:\nThe ability to hide complex \nimplementation details and show only \nthe necessary features of an object. This \nsimplifies the interaction with objects.\n\nAbstraction in OOP: \nTypes of abstraction:\n- Data abstraction: data abstraction focuses \non what data is used and what operations \ncan be performed on it, while hiding how \nthe data is implemented.\n-  Control abstraction: Control abstraction \nfocuses on hiding complex logic and \ncontrol flow inside methods, so the user \ndoes not need to know how something is \ndone.\nclass BankAccount {\n    private double balance;\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\npublic void processOrder() {\n    validateOrder();\n    calculatePrice();\n    saveToDatabase();\n    sendConfirmation();\n}\n"
